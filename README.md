I am an Doctoral student of Decision Sciences at IIM Bangalore. Before joining IIMB, I worked for multiple education institutes across Assam, Mumbai & Bengaluru. In August 2016, I started my Ph.D. journey in Statistics.

My primary field of work is related to time series data. Previously, I studied at the Delhi University, where I completed my Bachelor's degree (in 2009) from LSR Delhi, and Master's degree (in 2011) in Statistics.

I am also interested in sports analytics, especially problems related to soccer.
